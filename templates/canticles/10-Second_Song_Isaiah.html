<p class = "old_style">Seek the Lord while he wills to
be found; * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call upon him when he draws near. <br>
Let the wicked forsake their ways * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the evil ones their thoughts; <br>
And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to our God, for he will richly pardon. <br>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor your ways my ways, says the Lord. <br>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so are my ways higher than your ways, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my thoughts than your thoughts. </p>
<p class = "old_style">For as rain and snow fall from
the heavens * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and return not again, but water the earth, <br>
Bringing forth life and giving growth, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seed for sowing and bread for eating, <br>
So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will not return to me empty; <br>
But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and prosper in that for which I sent it. </p>

<p class = "old_style">Glory to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit: * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it was in the beginning, is now, and will
be for ever. Amen. </p>
