<p class = "normal">Arise, shine, for your light has
come, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.
<br>
For behold, darkness covers the land; * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep gloom enshrouds the peoples. <br>
But over you the Lord will rise, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his glory will appear upon you. <br>
Nations will stream to your light, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and kings to the brightness of your dawning. <br>
Your gates will always be open; * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by day or night they will never be shut. <br>
They will call you, The City of the Lord, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. <br>
Violence will no more be heard in your land, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ruin or destruction within your borders. <br>
You will call your walls, Salvation, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all your portals, Praise. <br>
The sun will no more be your light by day; * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by night you will not need the brightness of
the moon.</p>

<p class = "normal">The Lord will be your everlasting
light, * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your God will be your glory. </p>

<p class = "normal">Glory to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit: * <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it was in the beginning, is now, and will
be for ever. Amen. </p>
